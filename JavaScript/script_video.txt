Hello everyone I am ___________ currently pursuing <B Tech.> 3rd Year <CSE> from Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya.
I am here to give the detailed description of our solutions for the taken problem statement by us named "Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra".
This is a type of facility that is used to poset any product using post office at international level. Although in doing 
so their are various problems to be faced either on individual level, government or on the commercial level.
1. Individual level: Posting time(delay service), document verification(authentication).
2. Government level:
3. Commercial level: The private e-Commerce portals charge upto 40% of the sale price of orders, which is prohibitively expensive
* The aim of Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra is to simplify and streamline the export process for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
  by leveraging the extensive postal network and infrastructure already in place.

                                            OUR SOLUTION/ IDEA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* We are creating an e-commerce platform which will provide opportunity to MSME's and local trader
* In which we are using collaborative resources that means sharing of platform
* Organized supply chain will provide 


Collabration resources: for example different shop 2 delivery , collab shops of same plaform . Without collaboration we 
			have to pay more charges for example if 2 delivery persons are delivering the product with two shops 
			for the same purpose then the cost will be increases such as transport  cost, GST ect. This can be 
			reduced if we collaborate with different shops/ platforms. 
Payment Gateway: loyalty programs (our bank particular discount). Payment gateway include the secured payment services and an 
		extra feature will be given by us that if any customer having an account in IPPB and having a minimum amount in 
		their account only than we will give some amount of discount. 
Environmental initiative: packaging (Paper bags), eco friendly. We will use such type of product which doesn't harm our ecosystem.

industrail partnership : digital media, manufacturers (collab) for high charge. Different platform has to pay more charges,
			we can provide an offer that we will reduce their charges, in return we can demand the advertisment of
			our website/ product.

Organised supply chain: In supply chain we can implement by using (collection unit + distribution unit = Control unit(major role))
			This can be done with the integration of AI/ML. Enhance the supply chain of E commerce.

Chatbots with multilingual support: We will provide multiple languages facility and a chatbot so that the user will get immediate response.

-----------------------ARCHITECTURE--------------------------------------------------------

The architecture shown here describes that 
Authority for customer is: A customer can sign up/ sign in, view product catalog, the options such as wishlist, add to cart,
			   order (payment gateway will be used), mode of delivery, return , feedback all are accessible for any user.
Seller's functionallity: Sign up option for new seller / sign in, list products, update the product and its details as well ,
			receive order (payment gateway will be used), in ship product package tracking service is used,
			for customer order logs and status we will use some ML algorithms (optimized supply chain). This will 
			linked with DNK platform. The seller can also has the access of customer feedback and make changes 
			in future if required.
